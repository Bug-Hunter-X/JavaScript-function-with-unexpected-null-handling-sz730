# JavaScript Function with Unexpected Null Handling

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in a JavaScript function that handles null values in its parameters.  The function appears to work correctly, but it may mask unexpected null values that may arise under unexpected situations during the normal operation of the application. 

## Bug Description

The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers. It correctly handles cases where one or both of the input parameters are null. However, this handling may conceal unexpected issues arising from null values.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `bug.js`.
3. Run the code using Node.js or a similar JavaScript environment.
4. Observe the output.  While the explicit null checks are working, they may mask a problem within the application's logic causing unexpected nulls to arrive at this function. 

## Solution

The solution demonstrates more robust error handling that distinguishes between explicit null checks and unexpected nulls, thereby providing better feedback during the runtime of the application and potentially helping pinpoint the source of the unexpected null values.

## Additional Notes

This example highlights the importance of considering all scenarios when writing code, especially how to handle unexpected conditions such as null values or other similar situations.  Robust error handling improves code maintainability and helps to reduce unexpected behavior during runtime.
